Thunderbird Extension Custom Sender Address and Reply
=====================================================

This is a stub and needs to be written.

Overview
--------


For a local installation create a file named  
your_thunderbird_profile/extensions/cusedar@sethdepot.org  
with it's only content being the path where you downloaded or cloned
this extension.  
Please take care that currently the settings (and other stuff)
still share their names with Flexible Identity, so expect trouble when you
have both extensions installed.
